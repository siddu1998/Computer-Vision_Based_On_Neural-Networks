# Computer-Vision_Based_On_Neural-Networks
Implementation of 1) Paul Viola 2) SSN algorithm and 3)GAN algorithm from Scratch

The Code contains the implementation of the above using powerful Deep Learning frameworks and the calculated errors are
Proagated using PyTorch Framework, apart from that basic OpenCV was used to detect emotion based on open source haar-cascade files.

You will not be able to run the code straight away, please make sure you download the datasets which include PASCAL-VOC2012 and apart from that a correct installation of PyTorch
I will update the same with more theoretical notes and also provide screen shots of the directory structures.

Chao!
